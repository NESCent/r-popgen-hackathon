# Population Genetics in R Hackathon

The National Evolutionary Synthesis Center ([NESCent]) sponsored a hackathon to be held at NESCent's headquarters in Durham, North Carolina, on March 16-20, 2015. The event aimed to help foster an interoperating ecosystem of scalable tools and resources for population genetics data analysis in the popular R platform. 

The hackathon targeted interoperability, scalability, and workflow building challenges among the many population genetics R packages that already exist. It allowed a diverse group of population genetics researchers, method developers, and people with other relevant areas of expertise to collaborate on code, documentation, use-cases, and other resources that will aid their communities.
